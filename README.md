### Description

Counter Assault is an arcade-style space shooter game. I intend to create advanced features such as Heat-Seeking missles, laser-powerups, bombs, and possibly even a story. It's pretty fun how it is, however. Right now, it has the basic enemy engine, enemies that move around and swurve, power-ups, such as Invincibility for 10 seconds, Health and Energy refuels. The energy system is simple: You shoot a laser, the energy of your ship goes down a little. If it reaches 0 (critical level) it takes away from your health every time you shoot. The game's completely lag free, since BLTing in DirectX is a walk in the park on even the worst computers.

Enjoy.

### More Info
 
Use Space to shoot, move with he arrow keys.

Doesn't work on some kinds of DirectX versions... I have no clue why, it's just some people told me it didn't work.
